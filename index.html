<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Jorge Rodriguez</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Jorge Rodriguez, I just graduated from CSULA this past summer, and I'm currently working as a process engineer at a paper mill. My career goals are to be able to work from home in the future and I think programming would give me a great chance at that. I like to watch football and horror movies in my downtime. I have some experience with HTML as I have used HTML code to streamline reports I make at work. My goal for this course is to be able to have a deeper understanding of how to utilize HTML and CSS in my current career. </p>
